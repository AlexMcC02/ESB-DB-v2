# Extrasolar Bodies Database v2.0
This is inspired from a project I completed at university. This is a very simple one page application that displays data of exoplanets orbiting the parent body as specified by the user. The data is retrieved from the Exoplanet Archive, a free resource that doesn't require an API key.
